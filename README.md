# InfiniteRunner
A game created at the Porto Game Jam 2015 competition.
This competition involved a team of 3 elements creating a game in 32 hours on the theme "glitches".

Instructions:
The game is played by using the w,a,d or arrow keys to move and jump around the screen while avoiding the obstacles.
There's a catch though, every once in a while the game will "glitch" for a few seconds and something random will happen (gravity change, ultra speed, no jumps, etc.).
Play the game and find out every glitch!
